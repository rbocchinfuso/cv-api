# CV API

## Summary
An Curriculum Vitae (Resume) API 

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always DM me on the twitter @rbocchinfuso._

### Why
- Just for fun.
- Because I can.
- Inflight boredom and shitty United WiFi.
- Because we learn by doing.
- Because we live in an API driven world.
- The motivation for the CV API is a long story, but the key reason that I decided to build this was really driven by a desire to create a gate for those looking to inspect my CV. I wanted a way to inspect the inspector without having to do the inspection. More details on my motivations can be gleamed from a blog I published here: http://bit.ly/372imHl

### How
- Create a JSON structure to store CV details.
    - Thank you to https://jsonresume.org/ for providing an existing standard.
- Build API with Python and Flash
- Package and containerize API
- Automate deployment
